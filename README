PROJECT PYTHAGORAS

This project is my attempt at building a robust math utility.

CURRENT FEATURES:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Simplifies expressions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)

STILL TO BE ADDED:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- More (basic) function: exponents, radicals, parentheses, etc. 
- Parenthetical expressions
- Simplifying algebraic expressions
- Solving algebraic equations
- Probably a lot more

VERSION OVERVIEW:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.0.1
First commit, very raw. Addition and subtraction only.

v0.0.2
Still not superior code. Lots of cleaning up to do. Added support for multiplication and division. Support for parenthetical expressions coming soon. Tweaked the function of the Parser class. Now, it is solely static methods that parse strings into the different subcategories (initial input, expressions, terms)
